As the pandemic continues, Case Consulting launched yet another virtual internship program, hosting 5 new interns to learn all about web development and new technologies. We started the internship off on a great note getting to learn about each other and sharing what we look forward to as we kick-off the new journey. After we finished setting up our laptops for development, an exciting scavenger hunt took place for everyone to unwind and have fun, to which I unfortunately lost alongside Austin. Way to go Charles (2020 Intern) for coming in First! I, as well as the other interns, Rahul, Kestin, Spencer, and Tom, have had a very enjoyable experience so far, and cannot wait to begin our journey with the team!
