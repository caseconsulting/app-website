Salamander Resort and Spa was selected by the majority of the company as the destination for our 2019 Holiday Party. This marks the 3rd time we've held this annual company party at the Middleburg resort. After checking into their hotel rooms, employees and their significant others gathered for hors d'oeuvres and cocktails before a family-style dinner featuring many tasty dishes.

After dinner it was time for the White Elephant. We do things a little differently here at Case where the gifts are mostly technology related and all provided by the company. Employees take turns (in hire order) unwrapping and/or stealing already opened gifts. It is a very enjoyable event that employees look forward to and nobody goes home disappointed. A Macbook Air, several iPads and iWatches, and Sonos speakers proved to be the most popular gifts. See below for a timelapse video of the White Elephant.

Employees and their significant others were then given some seed money and sent into the casino to try their hand at Blackjack, Craps, Texas Hold 'Em, and Roulette. We've done casino night once before several years ago and it was really well liked, so it was brought back and was just as fun as before. At the end of the night each thousand dollars was exchanged for a raffle ticket that was entered to win one of two days of PTO. Former intern and future employee, Sam, won the first day off. As luck would have it the second day off was awarded to Doug who entered just one ticket into the raffle much to the chagrin of others who had dozens in the drawing.

Many employees called it a night while many others continued the conversation and fun around the pool table before eventually tunring in. It was a great night with the best coworkers anyone could ask for. See below for a slideshow of the whole night.
