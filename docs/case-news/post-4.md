Last month we were recognized as the best medium-sized company in the DC area. Yesterday we celebrated that recognition with a company event at McCormick & Schmick's Seafood & Steaks in Reston! In addition to enjoying the wonderful food and drink we took the time to discuss all of the great things Case employees continue to do for our customers. We also awarded the inaugural #CaseChampion award which is a biannual recognition of an employee that best demonstrates the Case Consulting pillars: Integrity & Professionalism, Client Focus & Performance Execution, Teamwork, and Continuous Learning & Innovation. It was an easy decision to recognize Paul Correll for his passion and dedication to the company and his performance and professionalism working with our customers. Along with the #CaseChampion cup, the recognition comes with a cool hoodie and 3 additional days of PTO!
