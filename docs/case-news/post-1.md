Today we welcome our newest hire, Katie Pitera. Katie is a Project Manger with more than 18 years of experience supporting our Customer and private industry. She received her Bachelor of Political Science from Emory University, is a Change Management Advanced Practitioner, and is a Project Management Professional (PMP).  Most recently she was accepted into UVA’s MS Management IT (MIT) program for Fall 2019. Katie and her husband, Chris, live in Stone Ridge and enjoy traveling. They recently returned from an amazing cruise which I’m sure she can tell us all about at our all hands later this month. Welcome, Katie!
