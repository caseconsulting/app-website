From nearly getting trapped in an escape room, to eating our way through Georgetown, we had a blast with Case Consulting this summer.

Throughout the first three weeks, we started building our custom theme office (#vuepress). When visiting our office, you may have found a wide range of sights: from unicorns to pineapples to our attempt at a garden. Maybe even a ball pit, but you would have had to be here to find out.

Each week we enjoyed seeing different members of the Case Consulting team during our scrum and stand-ups, with our President, Paul Farmer, acting as our customer.

After a short-while, we got accustomed to the native language of gifs. Using the company's gifbot tool made working and communicating with co-workers super fun.

Mike Frank introduced us to the world of cloud computing with talks that explored various AWS services. (Smart Dude). This allowed us to incorporate services such as Dynamo, S3 Buckets, Code Pipeline, SNS, Cloud Formation, and Lambda into our projects.

This summer we had the chance to work on three different projects - the <a href="https://www.consultwithcase.com/">Case Consulting Website</a>, Blog, and Expense App. If you are reading this then you can already tell that our blog is live!

We were able to make updates to the website, converting it from a static html file to a dynamic Vue App. In addition, we added an apply form to the website making it easy for applicants to <a href="https://www.consultwithcase.com/apply-form">apply</a> at the source. Spread the word.

Furthermore, we were able to squash multiple bugs on the company's internal Expense App. Meanwhile enhancing the look and feel of the app in addition to adding new features in this Vue.js application.

We were able to jump start our security clearance process hoping to join Case Consulting as full-time employees next summer. Thanks to everybody who helped make this internship program awesome sauce. Looking forward to taking our experiences with us throughout our careers.
