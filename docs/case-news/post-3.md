Please join me in welcoming Jacob Boisseau to Case Consulting as a full time hire! Jacob was one of our first interns through the internship program which started in 2017. He graduated this Spring from George Mason University with a degree in Computer Science and is eager to start working with our customer. Welcome, Jacob!
