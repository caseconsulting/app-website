Employees and their families gathered at Case Headquarters in Leesburg to reflect on the Summer, relax, and enjoy each other's company at the annual Case Family Picnic. Everyone enjoyed the beautiful not-Summer-but-not-quite-Fall weather and had plenty of great food and their favorite beverages.

The kids (and some adults) enjoyed the obstacle course and sports bounce houses and getting their faces (and arms) painted.

This year we added axe throwing into the mix. Led by a great instructor, most of the adults had a great time learning how to throw an axe.

It was a great time to catch up with old colleagues and friends. A special thanks to our hosts, the Farmers, who always do an amazing job of ensuring that a good time is had by all!
