Over the past 14 weeks, we had a great time working with new tools and learning what it's like to work at Case!

The first few weeks, we binged tons of tutorials and attended a variety of lectures hosted by employees at Case. We also learned about the technologies used in creating and managing the Case website and portal. (Thanks to the intern cadre and Max Schwarzmuller!)

After that, we started our development journey with the Case Portal with the help of the intern cadre. Throughout the internship, we worked on adding beautiful statistics graphics of employee data, enhancing the employee profile page, as well as fixing bugs from prior interns (definitely couldn’t have been from us). Additionally, we worked on AI/ML with Robert’s and Sneha’s help. We utilized Amazon’s Textract and Comprehend services to add resume parsing functionality to the employee profile page.

However, all great tales have a downfall, and oh boy do we have some downfalls. Let’s start off with the <b>'Battle of CORS'</b>. We first saw this issue when working on the CloudFormation lab, and ever since then, this issue has been creeping up on everything we worked on in the portal. This was a great battle, with numerous hours spent in vanquishing the numerous CORs issues. But alas, we came out victorious (I think). Another great conquest was <b>'The Great Comma Crisis'</b>, caused by the inconsistencies of commas being present for the dollar amounts across the portal. This, too, was vanquished by the brave heroes of the 2021 Interns.

As the internship came to an end, we were finally able to all meet up and see each other in person! We saw the office space, ate lunch at Not Your Average Joes, went go-karting, and played Top Golf. Overall, we learned a great amount about being full-stack developers and enjoyed our summer at Case!
