With the world half on lock down due to a pandemic, that did not stop Case Consulting from launching an internship program, welcoming 6 new awesome interns this summer. Although we could not host the program in Make Offices as we have had for the last 3 year, the internship cadre has put together a program to continue fully remote. Using AWS Workspace, we were able to set up an environment for the interns to do their training and continue improving our intern project from day one, the Expense App. As normal, stand-ups and talks persist on a daily basis through the use of Google-Meets as we drop in and say hello. Welcome to the team Helen, Zertash, Pablo, Diego, Charles, and Rachel!
