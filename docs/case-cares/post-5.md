On Dec 13th, I volunteered with Pathway Home's Annual Resident Holiday party. The event was hosted to celebrate the holiday season with about 150 residents and 40 volunteers. Pathway Homes is a charitable organization providing non-time-limited housing and supportive services to adults with serious mental illness and co-occurring disabilities in Northern Virginia.

This is my second year helping with Pathway Homes events. Last year I volunteered along with my daughter at the Pathway Homes Homeless Walk fundraiser in October as well as the Resident Holiday Party in December. Both last year and this year, the party was held at Church of the Good Shepherd in Burke, VA.

At the event, I helped with setup, baking green beans and onion casserole, reheating delivered food, cooking, setting up the buffet table, serving at the buffet, packing leftovers, cleaning in the kitchen, cleaning and packing decorations.
