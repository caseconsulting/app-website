We were thrilled to be able to sponsor two foursomes for the <a href="https://www.ciamemorialfoundation.org/" target="_blank">CIA Memorial Foundation's</a> First Annual <a href="https://www.ciamemorialfoundation.org/khowst-memorial-event" target="_blank">Khowst Memorial Golf Tournament</a>. Our teams overcame the heat at Evergreen Country Club in Haymarket, Virginia and had a great day competing with friends!
