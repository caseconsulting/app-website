"525,600 minutes. How do you measure a year?" goes the popular song <i>Seasons of Love</i> from the musical Rent. At Case Consulting, we have yet another way to measure a year: all of the great things our employees are doing as part of the Case Cares program. At our all-hands meeting in November of 2018 we announced the this program. The aim is to make it easier for our employees to give back. Case employees can use their annual technolgy budget of $1,800 to purchase equipment or donate directly to a charity of their choosing. We also started an internal Basecamp project for people to share the great things they were doing. There employees have self-organized to support larger volunteer opportunities like Wreaths Across America at Arlington National Cemetery. Employees were also given 8 hours per year to volunteer for any organization they choose. Our employees have been quite busy this past year:

* As part of the Readers Are Leaders program, Coach Bobby took the Dominion High School boys soccer team to read at a local elementary school

* Diane helped stuff 1000 Easter baskets for children in family shelters

* Diane also spent some time helping the special education teachers at Armstrong Elementary School

* Paul C. spent several hours demonstrating science with his biology teacher wife at several local elementary schools

* John L. joined the 5 gallon club for donating 5 gallons of blood

* Suzanne volunteered at her Synagogue and connected new American citizens in need with legal aid

* John C. volunteered at a haunted house in Gainesville, VA that supports the Haymarket food pantry

* Bobby G supported the Columbus Day Parade in Sterling, VA with the Knights of Columbus

* Bobby G again supported the Salvation Army food truck

* Diane crocheted two blankets to be given to those in need of comfort

* Mike supported Scouting for Food with his son's troop at the Food for Others warehouse in Merrifield, VA

* Janet helped with after-school enrichment programs at her daughter's elementary school

* Nancy delivered Thanksgiving meals for Food and Friends supporting people with HIV/AIDS, cancer, and other serious illnesses

* Paul C. and his family supported Operation Christmas Child, Toys for Tots, and the Salvation Army Angel Tree

* Janet also supported the PTA at her daughter's school by helping with their annual Santa Shop

* Brian J. and his family once again supported Operation Christmas Child at the Baltimore/Washington Shoebox Processing Center

* John L. helped distribute wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery as part of Wreaths Across America

* Mike and his family helped serve Christmas Eve dinner to those in need at Epiphany Episcopal Church in Herndon

* Brian M. spent time teaching technical skills to Navy veteran who is paralyzed from the chest down

* CarrieAnne helped the Military Order of the Purple Heart collect and purchase goods to make Christmas baskets for veterans that live in the VA hospital

It is safe to say that Case Cares has really taken off. Thank you to all of the employees that have given back. We can't wait to see what everyone will do in year two!
