Case employee, Bob Gannon, has always looked to improve himself and his community in any way he can. From volunteering with the Salvation Army to feeding the less fortunate to coaching high school soccer he has dedicated himself to the greater good. It was in this same vein that he began talking with our owner, Paul Farmer, about ways the company could make a greater impact on our communities. 

When Mr. Gannon's wife, who teaches at Meadowland Elementary in Sterling, VA, came to him with a need to provide iPads for a classroom he sprung into action. He proposed that he be allowed to use some of his annual technology budget to support these needs. Seeing a grand slam idea, Mr. Farmer, not only agreed to the idea, but the company actually chipped in to buy several additional iPads (4 total). A few months later this benefit was rolled out to the entire company and the Case Cares program was born.

He wasn't done there. Bobby's niece, Caitlin Gannon, teaches 1st grade in the Granite School District in West Valley, Utah. Being a new teacher at a title 1 school meant that she had limited funds to help her launch some of the project-based learning initiatives that she knew would help her students reach their academic goals. So, when the new school year started to take shape, Ms. Gannon was looking for a S.T.E.A.M. (Science Technology Engineering Arts and Math) project that she could use to introduce the kids to the concepts of computer programming and software development. Enter <a href="https://www.learningresources.com/botleyr-the-coding-robot" target="_blank">Botley the Coding Robot from Learning Resources</a>. Botley is "ready to code right out of the box", and "helps kids as young as 5 start coding without the need for a screen!" Uncle Bobby came to the rescue, using his technology budget to buy a full (10) classroom set of Botley robots and an iPad. The early results are in: the kids love them! Caitlin and her students expressed their appreciation to Case Consulting and the Case Cares program with the video below:

In addition to being able to use part of their technology budget to purchase supplies via websites like Donors Choose, Case Consulting employees also get 1 day per year to volunteer for a cause of their choosing. There are no strings attached, no paperwork to file, no boss to ask. The only requirement is that each employee share the stories of their volunteer days. What did it mean to them? Why did they choose that organization? What was their impact? This way employees can see what everyone else is doing and could spark ideas of their own. <a href="http://localhost:8080/case-cares/post-1.html">Read about how Bobby spent his time volunteering for the Salvation Army</a>!

Another aspect of Case Cares is organizing and volunteering as a group. Last January, several employees, including Mr. Gannon, joined the Wreaths Across America organization in cleaning up the wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery (<a href="https://blog.consultwithcase.com/case-cares/post-8.html">read more here!</a>). There are no gimmicks here either; just pure hard work in an effort to enrich lives and communities. We are looking forward to working with Wreaths Across America again this year and hopefully can add other volunteer opportunities!

Mr. Gannon added, "Much appreciation to Paul [Farmer] and the Case family for giving us the opportunity; not many companies would do that. It's pretty freaking cool to have a 'coding robot' in her classroom!" Thank YOU, Bobby, for all that you have done and continue to do for our communities and our youth!
