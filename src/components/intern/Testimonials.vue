                "Case Consulting is an awesome company that has its hands in a lot of interesting technology. At this internship, I learned what it meant to be professional in the field, I learned full-stack technologies such as NodeJS and industry standards such as
                OAuth. We also got opportunities to explore the Amazon ecosystem and deployed an application into the real world that will be used by real people. The Case internship is a rewarding opportunity that is centered around great mentors that
                will do everything to help you succeed."

                and used tech that I found interesting every day I was there."

                "After completing this internship, I feel as though I went from a programmer who only wanted to stay in the backend to a full stack developer who can switch between the frontend and backend depending on the needs of the team. Through the internship you
                will learn how to be an agile developer, while working with cutting edge web technologies such as Vue, Node.js, AWS services, and Express."

                "Working at Case Consulting was a great opportunity for me to learn and experience what being a software developer is like in the real world. While I was at my internship, I was able to work in an encouraging, friendly environment where we designed a
                website and an expense app that would be used by the company's employees. In doing so, I was able to work with new technologies and agile programming that is used by employees in the company. This internship helped me get a good view of

                "My summer internship with Case Consulting provided me with a solid foundation for full-stack web application development that was lacking from my college education. Having the opportunity to work in an Agile environment with bleeding-edge technologies
                and experiencing how a software company operates has really prepared me for my career after graduation. Working in a collaborative team of other interns helped me to realize my own strengths as a developer, and we had an awesome time building
                an application that we are really proud of, under the guidance of the knowledgeable and approachable senior developers at Case. I would eagerly recommend an internship with Case to anyone with a desire to learn AWS, JavaScript, or web
                application development, without hesitation."
