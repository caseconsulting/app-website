        We are looking for highly motivated and bright students to continue building the foundation of our summer intern
        program. Guided by our team of software professionals, and previous Interns, you will apply cutting edge
        software development tools and practices to a real software product that you will build from the ground up. Some
        of the technologies considered for the project are Vue/Angular/React, Node/Express, and Bootstrap/Google
        Material Design. Throughout the program, Interns will use many software engineering best practices such as
        agile/scrum, pair programming, automated testing, and test-driven development. If you are eager to hone the
        skills learned at school and want to work on a real-world problem, from concept to delivery, while working for
        an established company of software professionals, then please consider applying for a summer internship with
        Case Consulting!
