        `The amount of work experience that I accumulated at Case was incredible. I was working every day as
        a full-stack developer in an agile environment. I was able to interact with real world tools such as
        AWS and with a fully realized application to add to, and improve, functionality. We experienced full 
        production cycles and were given free reigns to work on the application. Before this internship I 
        wondered what a real work environment would feel like. Now I feel comfortable in one.`

        `My internship at Case was truly eye opening in helping me figure out what type of development and technologies
        I like working with by exposing me to web development, AWS services, and testing. I had the ability to experience
        the life of a full stack developer in a real work environment including daily sprints, feedback on my code, and 
        various talks on different technologies. I can easily say I have learned so much more from this one summer than 
        I ever could have imagined. Overall, it was a very well rounded experience, and I got to work with an 
        amazing team!

        how a Software Developer functions in the workplace. Working on the intern team has given me a great 
        understanding of git, full stack web development, what it's like to develop for a customer, and even 
        AWS. It was also a lot of fun to spend time with the company during events and meetings. Overall, the
