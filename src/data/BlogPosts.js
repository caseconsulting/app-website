      "I spent a few hours of my volunteer time supporting an effort I've supported a few years now - the local Loudoun County Salvation Army Food Truck. Each week local organizations (civic, community, church) take a turn preparing meals to be distributed to those in need at the Sterling and Leesburg locations. Typically its a hot meal, but can also be sandwiches, etc. Donations are gathered at the organization, placed on the truck, and away we go to hand out food to those in need.",

This was my second Watch Dog day since mid-October, and it was just as enjoyable as the first. As you'll see in the schedule below every minute is accounted for and it makes for a tired dog at the end of the day.",
