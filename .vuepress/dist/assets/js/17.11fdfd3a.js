Everyone involved gives a lot of time and effort, working to ensure the program is not an average internship experience, but rather true development of the skills required to succeed as a software engineer in the real world.","Before the completion of a successful internship you can expect to receive an offer for full time employment with Case Consulting, including your minimum starting salary and benefits. We understand that this is a big commitment, but we believe you will love our culture as much as we do and will want to stay well past any specified commitment time period."]},{question:"Where is your full-time work?",answer:["Case Consulting has quite a few projects to place college new hires on when they start full time.
